# Welcome to my GIS and Python portfolio!

Below is a collection of ArcGIS and Python projects I have completed. 


## Rundown of GIS Projects
- Zoo Escape Map	
	- Map depicting a buffer of one kilometer around schools in the event of zoo animal escapes
	- Code contained in ZooScript.py for buffers created using Python in ArcGIS Pro
	
- Python Zoo
	- Contains python script used to automate process of listing animal species sighted by field workers
	
- Site Selection
	- Translated and exported a model created in Model Builder into Python
	
- Gilligan City Spatial Analysis
	- http://arcg.is/0Gn9Xv
	- Map originally created in ArcGIS Pro and exported to a Web App
	- Contains spatial analysis layers built around a parcel that an owner intends to change the zoning on
	- Uses buffer, union, intersect, and clip analysis tools
	
- Mt Rainier temperature
	- http://arcg.is/1KCiO0
	- Raster analysis layers originally conducted in ArcGIS Pro, exported to a web layer
	- Uses varying parameters on IDW, Spline, and Kriging raster analysis tools
	
- Geocode with Python
	- Geocoded address list using Pandas, GeoPandas, and GeoPy
	- Created a Pandas dataframe from a csv file of addresses and plotted location with Matplotlib
	- Created 2 different versions of the map Folium and ArcGIS python module
	- Check them out by running the jupyter notebooks!

## Python Exercises
- PigLatin.py
	- A script that translates user input into the Pig Latin Language
	
- Radius.py
	- A script that references pi from the math module to calculate the radius of a circle when provided a value for radius from user input
